## Introduction
Hi there, this project is aimed at making a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (**CLI**) for the go lang based LCVS project.

As discussed in previous articles LCVS is short for Local Version Control System that aims at documenting and versioning.
It aims at providing a documentation tool that stores researches for each time a project is done.
basically version control for docs along with code.

In this module we will deep dive into the concepts that i came across while making the CLI tool. The CLI tools mainly aims at

**Provide CLI support such as initialization, semantic versioning, store files in snapshot format, code linkage**
